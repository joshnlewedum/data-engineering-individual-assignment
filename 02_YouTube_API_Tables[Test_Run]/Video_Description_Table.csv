Good Luck!

This Video is Sponsored by Topman

In this video I teamed up with my man Kikks Officailal to take on a challenge that a lot of our followers have asked for.

A lot of our followers have been asking me how they can style an outfit on lower budget and still look cool without spending all their money on designer items. So we got some items in from Topman to see if we could style two designer jackets with Topman items and still look cool. We then headed down to Shoreditch to ask members of the public their opinion on who styled their outfit the best, enjoy!"

▼ BIO

So earlier this week TheHoxton Trend team headed over to Milan to catch up with Certilogo and whilst their they headed over to the recent Stone Island Prototype Series 4 Exhibition which coincided with Milan Design Week. Luckily they managed to grab a few great pictures of the latest collection.

The exhibition itself was installed by Ken-Tonio Yamamoto and Nina Heydorn at their Milan based showroom, the latest Prototype Research Series sees Stone Island now iconic Nylon Metal fabric receiving a 2019 update.

According to Stone Island, “The Nylon Metal is sprayed with an adhesive substance and then exposed to the cotton flock. The creation of an electromagnetic field straightens the fibres, which are attracted by the garment due to the uniqueness of this technique. The garment is then dyed with double recipe, nylon and cotton, providing highly contrasting colours for a unique and unrepeatable effect, different on each garment. The flock will wear off naturally, especially on areas subject to rubbing. The addition of a special agent to the dyeing recipe makes the garment anti-drop.”

The Stone Island Prototype Research Series 04 will run until Sunday 14th April 2019 from 10AM – 7PM at the Stone Island Milan showroom which is located at Via Savona 54, 20144, Milan.

The first of many new Outfit Style Challenges Episodes we have lined up. in this episode me and @KikksOfficial look to style a pair of Reebok trainers which I think typically my followers are not huge fans of. Each armed with a £150 budget to shop at FootLocker we jump online to pick our fave pieces and then head out to speak to the general public to find out who's outfit they prefer. Can we style a pair of reeboks and make them look cool with a budget of less than £150?? 
Who will the general public pick as their fave outfit to match the trainers we selected. 
Let's find out. Enjoy

2018/05/07;igR_UzaUlHw;HOW TO USE THE CERTILOGO CODE;"▼ BIO
So in this episode I wanted to share with you guys how to actually use the Certilogo code on your designer items. I have covered this before however I thought a dedicated video again would be worth doing since many people where still unsure how to use it.
Enjoy!

If you don't know who Certilogo is then check my last video on Certilgo here:

In this episode I hang out with one of my followers who's just got in a bunch of new CP COMPANY SS18 bits, he actually got this stuff before the release as I shot this video back in February. He invited me down to a photoshoot he was doing so I thought I'd tag along.

2018/04/18;HagHAcE3VWc;How We Do Street Photography for INSTAGRAM | Ft PlatunumPhotogaphy3;"Bio
So many of my followers ask about the photoshoots we do for our Instagram and this is something that I am doing a lot more of these days. Brands send us items and we use the items to create content for videos and social media. Luckily because of the channel we have attracted so many aspiring photographers and models so we are able to put these shoots together to create cool shots. A lot of work goes into the shoots, and a lot of direction and guidance is needed to ensure that we get the content we want. I thought a creative vlog style video would be really helpful to show aspiring Instagram influencers, up and coming  brands etc, how we do it ourselves. Enjoy

2017/12/19;n3LQXLUW694;NOBIS WINTER JACKET AW17 REVIEW;"▼BIO 
This episode sees me team up with Nobis again to  supply me with premium clothing so I can create content for my followers that may not have been able to cover originally. 

I also like the fact the partnering up gives me the opportunity to introduce retailers to my followers, who constantly ask me for trusted stores. 

Most important to me is that I do right by my followers, I would always ensure that I refer my followers to places that are trusted and verified. If I feel a retailer is not right for me or for my followers then I just wouldn't partner with them, no matter what the offering was. 

At the same time there are many retailers out there that are passionate about what they do and offer great service and these are the types of retailers I want to share woth my followers. In future I would love to cover more videos about how a these retail stores came about and even meet them for a chinwag about clothing. For now though let's have a look and enjoy some of the premium clothing that Mainline have to offer us this episode, Nobis.

I've been on to this brand for a while now and I do kinda like it although it is priced similar to the Canada Goose, which is not cheap. 

For those that are looking for a premium winter jacket but are looking for somehting a little unique and different, Nobis could be one to keep on your list.

I've managed to receive 4 Nobis Jackets from Mainline, the Rosco, Heritage, Cartel and the Yatesy. In this video I'll be looking into them in more detail and seeing what there all about.

Enjoy!!

▼I've been asked this question so much. Can you remove the Lens from a CP COMPANY item. I've finally found out and produced a quick guide video so you can easily see how it's done. Bare in mind I am not sure if the Lens can come off on all Cp Company but certainly all the items I had the lens came off no worries. Enjoy
